            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Napole is a wearable and app that help blind people to have a better orientation about a specific route
                created by them in Google Maps.
                <br><br>
                This interaction is made using Lilypad Arduino, a Bluetooth module and some vibbers, all this stuff
                attatched to the Napole Cap.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <div class="flexing">
        <div class="half left">
            <h4>Blindness</h4>
            <p>In the world, more than 204 millions of people are affected by blindness. And it's difficult for this
                poblation to travel because they need to trust a new route to go to a place.</p>
            <h4>Trust in new routes</h4>
            <p>User have fear when they are going to explore new routes using Google Maps, cause they can get lost when
                the voice of the app speaker wasn't understandable or other facts.</p>

            <h4>Blind tech</h4>
            <p>In our references, we have some devices for blind people like Victor Reader Trek a GPS that can give you
                directions with earphones, or Beacons Technology, the one to mark some interest points in places that
                have this Beacons, and the maps app can know what place it is.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>For the wearable we use LilyPad Arduino, the RN-42 Bluetooth module, a buzzer for sounds that are related with
        the trip and 5 vibbers for the directions: front, right, left, front-right and front-left. All of this were
        attatched to a cap using the Lilypad conductor thread and we use it as our low prototype.</p>
    <div class="flexing">
        <div class="half left">
            <h4>Wearable lifetime</h4>
            <p>The Lilypad is powered by a 3.7V battery that have a duration of 1 to 3 hours based on the board process.
                And is covered with a patch on the cap for the safety on the user when there is a rainy day.</p>

    <h2>Application Development</h2>
    <p>The mobile app were developed using Android Studio to test the Bluetooth connection. The interface is designed
        thinking in the blind people, using gestures to support TalkBack and voice commands.</p>

    <h2>Userflow</h2>
    <div class="flexing">
        <div class="half left">
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>To start using Napole, first you need to start a trip in Google Maps, blind people can do this with
                their voice using different types of commands.
                <br><br>
                You would need to start the navigation for a better experience with Napole.</p>

        <div class="half right">
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Wear the Napole Cap, turn it on just pressing the patch. Then open the app and just tap the initial
                screen to sync the information of your Google Maps route in the device.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="flexing">
        <div class="half left">
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>The vibbers of the Napole Cap would vibe in a secuential order as an example for you to test if the
                actual level of vibration.
                <br><br>
                If the user think is too strong or weak, they can change it using their voice
                commands, then they would tab to start the trip.</p>

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>While walking, the user would recibe a vibration in the direction where they have to go,
                this vibration react with directions like turn left, cross the street or keep walking.</p>

        <div class="half left">
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>When they arrived to their destiny the app would check that the route was completed and activate the
                buzzer to play a song to let the user know that the travel ends.</p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>For the user testing we use a computer with Arduino Desktop to send different chars in the Serial Monitor, and a
        USB wire connected to this PC and the Lilypad. Depending of the char it will send different types of vibration
        to the Lilypad based on a specific direction.

            <h4>Blind simulation</h4>
            <p>We create a headband where the Lilypad is attatched and the vibbers to put it around the head. And
                simulate blindness with a band that cover the eyes.</p>

            <h4>Walking without cognitive charge</h4>
            <p>In this test, the user were focused only in the vibrations of the band while he was walking in a
                treadmill. We send vibrations and he had to move him hand to the direction he percibes the vibration. We
                repeat this process 10 times.</p>

            <h4>Walking with cognitive charge</h4>
            <p>This second test was quite similar to the first but the subject had to talk with te interviewer and
                moving
                him hand while he was telling a story. With this test, we want to prove that the user can do more tasks
                while they are wearing the headband.</p>
