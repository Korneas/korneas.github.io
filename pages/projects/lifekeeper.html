    <h2>About Project</h2>
    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>Nowadays, university students in Colombia don’t know the basics of first aid, which limits their ability to act
        quickly in cases that require immediate attention to save a life.</p>
    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <h4>Interview</h4>
    <p>We surveyed 40 students from different universities in Cali (Colombia) using interviews and surveys. Information
        was collected about what they knew about first aid, if they had been in situations that required it and how they
        reacted to it.</p>
    <h4 class="alternate">Overall Results</h4>
    <h4>Design Principles</h4>
    <p>As a result of analyzing the interview results, we created design principles based on the insights that were
        gathered from problems by the first aid entities to cover the university public, as well as how the students can
        help to save the life of another person immediately.</p>
    <h2>Userflow</h2>
    <p>We create different functions to do inside Lifekeeper, that describe system behaviour for each user
        purpose. <br /> List of flows we’ve covered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn about first aid techniques</li>
        <li>Read news about the medicine world</li>
        <li>Call for help during an emergency</li>
        <li>Apply to volunteer profile in the city</li>
    </ul>
