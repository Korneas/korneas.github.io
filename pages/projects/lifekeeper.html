            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Nowadays, university students in Colombia don’t know the basics of first aid, which limits
                their ability to act quickly in cases that require immediate attention to save a life.</p>
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>Design an interactive experience aimed at university students in the city of Cali (Colombia), so they can
                learn first aid and emergency services</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <h4>Interview</h4>
    <p>We surveyed 40 students from different universities in Cali (Colombia) using interviews and surveys. Information
        was collected about what they knew about first aid, if they had been in situations that required it and how they
        reacted to it.</p>

    <br>
    <h4>Design Principles</h4>
    <p>As a result of analyzing the interview results, we created design principles based on the insights that were
        gathered from problems by the first aid entities to cover the university public, as well as how the students can
        help to save the life of another person immediately.</p>
