    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>In the city of Cali, Colombia, there are around ten thousand blind people walking the streets and sharing with
        their friends everyday. They recognize that there are difficulties when they want to do tourism activities
        because the city infrastructure isn’t ready for them due to the lack of accessibility.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>The “Zoológico de Cali” is one of the most important touristic places in Cali, but unfortunately, the experience
        doesn’t have the accessibility needed for blind or partially sighted visitors.</p>
    <div class="image-banner">
        <img src="/img/projects/hictio/problem_zoo.png" alt="Zoo photos" class="center-h">
    </div>
    <p>And the aquarium is the most critical point, only offers visual stimuli to learn about the animals and don’t
        have accessible guides to walk around as a blind.

    <h2>Field Work</h2>
    <h4>Human-centered design</h4>
    <p>We visit the zoo with two blind people and one partially sighted person to tour the place and study the
        experience. We told them to think aloud their ideas and impressions in every exhibition, specially in the
        aquarium. Also, we did an immersive experience covering our eyes in the butterflies and the birds exhibition to
        understand the experience as a blind person.</p>

            <h4>Touch</h4>
            <p>Haptic stimuli represents in blind people the creation of a cognitive image to understand their
                surrounding. That's why they love to touch statues or animals replicas in the tour, cause it represents,
                as they said, a valuable and remarkable experience.</p>

            <h4>Listen</h4>
            <p>Blind people use their phones with screen readers such as “VoiceOver” and “TalkBack” to give them
                information about their navigation inside an app. This makes that they always want to get sound feedback
                in the experience, creating context of the exhibition, as the narrative stories do in some of them.</p>

            <h4>Talk & Share</h4>
            <p>The use of social applications like Facebook, Whatsapp or Instagram, in the blind context, help them to
                keep close their friends to create blind community as they can do activities together like blind soccer,
                hiking, hear tv narrated series and more.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <h4>Process</h4>
    <p>To deliver meaningful experiences we started brainstorming ideas to solve the problem for different perspectives
        using as a base a customer journey map, that explain the emotions the blind people feel while doing a tourism
        activity.

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>In our field investigation, we made different tests to 8 blind people, to get feedback from the items or to keep
        record of how they interact with our prototype.</p>

    <h4>Haptic Experience</h4>
    <p>To understand the blind process to create a cognitive image through tactile surfaces, we made physical fishes
        replicas that were touched by the users. As a result we identified the most touched parts of the fishes where we
        installed vibro-tactile sensors to trigger interactions.</p>

    <h4>Mobile App Usability</h4>
    <p>Based on the gestures they used to do specific interactions in their phone, we test different gestures navigation
        systems for the blind userflow, and unique gestures for fish identification interaction.</p>

    <h4>Ergonomic Evaluation</h4>
    <p>We made different structures and conducted an ergonomic evaluation with low fidelity prototype to set physical
        product height, and the height of the fishes replica in the installation related to the user.</p>

    <div class="space"></div>
    <h4>NFC Wristband</h4>
    <p>As the interaction inside the aquarium requires to know if the user is in the physical installation, we used NFC
        tech applied to tag holders and test which model was easiest to use. The result was that the slap-wristband with
        NFC tag inside was more familiar to wear and has a flexible size.</p>

    <p>Introducing Hictio, an interactive accessible system that combines physical and digital interaction to enhance
        the experience inside the “Zoológico de Cali” aquarium and improve the recall of information in the exhibition.
        <br><br>
        Integrates a mobile app that guides the visitor through the experience with audio narratives, a group of
        vibro-tactile fishes models attached to a physical installation, NFC wristband for each user that trigger
        interactions, and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) beacons for proximity events and exhibition marking.
    </p>
    <h2>UX Storytelling</h2>
    <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pQrXon1R8cY" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h2>Product Userflow</h2>
    <h4>1. Gesture-based Navigation</h4>
    <p>Hictio is a button-less mobile application, with gesture-based navigation. Using common gestures such as swipe,
        tap, double tap and pinch, for and easy user interaction with blind and sighted people.</p>
    <h4>2. Proximity Events</h4>
    <p>When BLE beacons are detected, the app shows and talk in where exhibition we’re located and triggers an
        interaction to collect the fish in the app. Just like a PokemonGo gameplay with proximity interaction instead of
        GPS.</p>
    <h4>3. Physical Interaction</h4>
    <p>The physical installation is located in the middle of the aquarium, it holds a TCP-IP Server with LAN connection,
        hosted in a Raspberry PI B+. The user can send messages to make the installation play a sound and locate it.</p>
    <h4>4. NFC Connection</h4>
    <p>Once the user is in front of the installation, the visitor puts the NFC wristband near the NFC reader. Now the
        server knows exactly to which user is connected with, in order to send instructions for the fish interaction.
    </p>
    <h4>5. Vibro-tactile Stimuli & Narrative Experience</h4>
    <p>Each fish replica has vibro-tactile sensors under its rubber skin that detect whether the fish has been touched
        or not. Depending on the point the user touch, an audio narrative is triggered in the app.</p>
